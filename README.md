## 🛠️ Installation  

### Requirements  
- Python 3.6 or newer  

### Quick Start  
```bash
# Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/akashkarn9486/CODSOFT_TASK4_ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS.git  

# Navigate to the project directory  
cd CODSOFT_TASK4_ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS  

# Run the application  
python rock_paper_scissors.py  
```
